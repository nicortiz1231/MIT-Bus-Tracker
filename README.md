# MIT-Bus-Tracker

My version of the Real Time Bus tracker from MIT xPro course.

This project was particularly diffucult for me but I learned a LOT about working with APIs and fetching data from sources open to the public.

In this project I had to get access to public bus routes and live geo locations of these buses to display them on a map while they're updating in real time.

This bus tracker app shows you the active busses in the Cambridge and also highlights the route from MIT's campus to Harvard's.
